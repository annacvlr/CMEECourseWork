## Code

###week2 
**align_seqs.py**: Aligns two DNA sequences and determines the best alignment score using a scoring system. 

**basic_csv.py**: Reads a CSV file to extract and display species name along with their body mass. 

**basic_io1** Reads a text file line by line printing each line, the second part skips blank lines.

**basic_io2** Saves the elements of a list to a file.

**basic_io3** Demonstrates how to save and load a python dictionary using the pickle module.

**Boilerplate.py**: Code serves a boilerplate, adding more functionality, documentation and error handling.

**cfexercises1.py**: Implements mathematical functions such as  calculating square roots, finding maximums, sorting lists, and computing factorials.

**cfexercises2.py**: Functions that print "hello" based on various conditions and loop structures.

**control_flow.py**: Functions that perform mathematical operations, such as identifying if a number is odd or even, if its prime etc...

**debugme.py**: Demonstrates error handling techniques using try/except blocks, showcasing common error scenarios.

**dictionary.py**: Populates a dictionary called taxa_dic derived from taxa so that it maps order names to sets of taxa and prints it to screen.

**lc1.py** Script extracts latin names, common names, and mean mass from tuple of bird data using list comprehensions and loops.

**lc2.py**: Script processes Uk rainfall data and demonstrates how to use list comprehensions and conventional loops to filter + display the data.

**loops.py**: Demonstrates how to use 
    - FOR loops: for iterating over a sequence
    - WHILE loops: continues WHILE a specific condition is TRUE

**MyExampleScript.py**: Takes a single argument x, squares it and prints result

**oaks_debugme.py**: This script reads a CSV file with plant taxonomy data, it then checks if each genus is "Quercus",oak, and writes the results in a new CSV file in the Results folder. 

**oaks.py**: Script identifies oak species from a list of plant names using traditional loops and list comprehensions.

**sysargv**: This script demonstrates how to handle command line arguments.

**test_control_flow.py**: This script determines whether a number is odd or even, with a function.

**tuple.py**: Script defines a tuple, with brid species latin name, common name and mass. 
    the script then iterates over the tupe and prints the details of each bird.

**using_name.py**: Demonstrates the use of the __name__ variable to differentiate between script execution and module importation.

##week3

**.Rhistory**: Performs variety of data manipulation tasks, focused on reading and writing CSV files, executing basic operations of matrices and demonstrating the differences between preallocating memory and dynamic growing vectors.

**apply1.R**:Performs statistical calculations on a randomly generated matrix.

**apply2.R**:Defines a function and demonstrates its application on a matrix.

**basic_io.R**:Handles and writes CSV files.

**boilerplate.R**:Creates a function that takes two arguments, prints their information and returns a combined vector.

**break.R**:Demonstrates how to break out of a loop using a WHILE loop.

**browse.R**:Debugging.

**control_flow.R**:Demonstrates various various control structures: conditional statements, for loops, and while loops.

**DataWrang.R**:Wrangling PoundHill dataset.

**Girko.R**:Visualise eigenvalues of a random matrix in relatoin to an ellpisem illustrating Girko's Circular law.

**MyBars.R**: Creates a bar chart on the data Results.txt and creates a pdf.

**MyFirstJupyterNB.ipynb**:A Jupyter Notebook with two different plots, using p.plot and qplot.

**next.R**: For loop that checks if number is odd using %% modulo and prints if it is.

**plotLin.R**:Creates a linear regression data and creates a pdf from it. 

**PoundHill.R**:Reads a CSV file into a dataframe and converts it into a matrix.

**preallocate.R**:Compares the performance of two functions, one without preallocated memory for a vector and one with. 

**R_conditionals.R**:Three functions that demonstrate how to use conditionals to check properties of numbers.

**sample.R**:Defines multiple functions to calculate the mean of random samples from a population and compares the execution time of different sampling methods, including loops with and without preallocation, as well as vectorized approaches using lapply and sapply.

**TestR.py**:Using subprocess package to run an R script (Test.R) and redirects the output and error messages to specified files"""

**TestR.R**:Prints "Hello, this is R!"

**TreeHeight.R**Function calculates the heights of trees given the distance of each tree from its base and angle to its top.

**try.R**:Function runs a simulation that involves sampling from a synthetic population w replacement and takes its mean but only if at least 30 unique samples are obtained.

**Vectorize1.R**:creates a large 1000x1000 matrix of random numbers, defines a function to compute the sum of all its elements using nested loops, and measures the execution time for this loop-based approach versus using the built-in vectorized sum function.
