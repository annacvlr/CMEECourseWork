# CMEE bootcamp Week2
Week 2 coursework of the Biological Computating Bootcamp

## Description
Week 2 covered Python in general including: variables, data structures, loops, conditionals, comprehensions, functions, docstrings and debugging.

## Languages 
Python
    
## Dependencies
**ipdb** : for enhanced debugging

  

## Installation
pip install ipdb
    

## Project Structure and Usage
- Code: Contains Python files
- Data: Where all the data used has been collected
- Results: Contains the results from the code. 


## Code
**align_seqs.py**: Aligns two DNA sequences and determines the best alignment score using a scoring system. 

**basic_csv.py**: Reads a CSV file to extract and display species name along with their body mass. 

**basic_io1** Reads a text file line by line printing each line, the second part skips blank lines.

**basic_io2** Saves the elements of a list to a file.

**basic_io3** Demonstrates how to save and load a python dictionary using the pickle module.

**Boilerplate.py**: Code serves a boilerplate, adding more functionality, documentation and error handling.

**cfexercises1.py**: Implements mathematical functions such as  calculating square roots, finding maximums, sorting lists, and computing factorials.

**cfexercises2.py**: Functions that print "hello" based on various conditions and loop structures.

**control_flow.py**: Functions that perform mathematical operations, such as identifying if a number is odd or even, if its prime etc...

**debugme.py**: Demonstrates error handling techniques using try/except blocks, showcasing common error scenarios.

**dictionary.py**: Populates a dictionary called taxa_dic derived from taxa so that it maps order names to sets of taxa and prints it to screen.

**lc1.py** Script extracts latin names, common names, and mean mass from tuple of bird data using list comprehensions and loops.

**lc2.py**: Script processes Uk rainfall data and demonstrates how to use list comprehensions and conventional loops to filter + display the data.

**loops.py**: Demonstrates how to use 
    - FOR loops: for iterating over a sequence
    - WHILE loops: continues WHILE a specific condition is TRUE

**MyExampleScript.py**: Takes a single argument x, squares it and prints result

**oaks_debugme.py**: This script reads a CSV file with plant taxonomy data, it then checks if each genus is "Quercus",oak, and writes the results in a new CSV file in the Results folder. 

**oaks.py**: Script identifies oak species from a list of plant names using traditional loops and list comprehensions.

**sysargv**: This script demonstrates how to handle command line arguments.

**test_control_flow.py**: This script determines whether a number is odd or even, with a function.

**tuple.py**: Script defines a tuple, with brid species latin name, common name and mass. 
    the script then iterates over the tupe and prints the details of each bird.

**using_name.py**: Demonstrates the use of the __name__ variable to differentiate between script execution and module importation.
